# World-Photo-Map
Windows 10 Stand-Alone Application to Add Photos to World Map


Currently arranged for Exotic Plant photos. However it is a template to add any types of photos.
Merely change the site's description & examples for a particular type of photo. Also, in all site files, replace each
'plant' & 'Plant' text string with the type of photos in your application. e.g.: 'plant' & 'Plant' equal 'mushroom' & "Mushroom'.

**Dowload ZIP** folder, then create a new site under inetpub/wwwroot on your computer.

Place unzipped files into that site's folder.

To run the application, in **localhost** select the index.htm file. 

You may then create/save/edit Photos to the World Map.

NOTE:To store your maps for the LIBRARY folder, the Windows IIS must have 
ASP files activated (See **Wiki** for a description how to do this).
